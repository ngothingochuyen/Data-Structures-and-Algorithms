# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

COURSE OUTLINE
Course Name:	Data Structures and Algorithms
 
COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course is a deep dive into the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering with a focus on data structures and algorithms, helping students to model practical problems, and equipping them with the knowledge and tools to construct efficient algorithms for these problems.

The course provides students with knowledge about data structures such as stack, queue, list, hashtable, etc., and algorithms for searching and sorting in lists, with an emphasis on the efficiency of these algorithms and how to use libraries and programming tools effectively. Students practice designing, analyzing, and implementing data structures using a programming language.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

Evaluate the complexity of different algorithms.

Design time and memory-efficient programs for practical problems.

Effectively use libraries and programming tools to enhance performance and code quality.
